### Tradon: AI-Powered Stock Forecasting Tool

#### Project Overview
Tradon is an innovative AI tool designed to revolutionize stock market forecasting by integrating Time Series Analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This multidimensional approach combines quantitative data analysis with qualitative insights from news and social media, delivering unparalleled accuracy in predicting stock movements. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms, Tradon empowers investors with a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, optimizing their investment strategies.

#### Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
Ensuring high-quality data is crucial for the performance of Tradon's AI models. The preprocessing phase involves several critical steps:
- **Data Loading and Initial Inspection**: Using pandas, we load the dataset with explicit column names for clarity. Initial inspections reveal issues such as missing values and class imbalances.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Features like 'sentiment' from news articles may contain missing values. Various imputation strategies are considered, but the optimal approach involves leveraging NLP techniques to infer missing sentiments.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical features, such as 'news source', are transformed into numerical representations using encoding techniques suitable for machine learning models.
- **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Feature importance is evaluated using machine learning models like Random Forests to identify and retain the most impactful features, enhancing model efficiency and performance.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA provides insights into the dataset's structure and highlights important trends:
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Analysis reveals the correlation between market sentiment and stock prices, showing how positive or negative news impacts market movements.
- **Temporal Trends**: Time series analysis identifies patterns in stock prices over time, revealing cyclical trends and significant events that influence market behavior.
- **Volume and Volatility**: Examination of trading volume and price volatility helps understand market dynamics and investor behavior.

#### Model Training and Evaluation
Tradon's model training involves several steps to ensure robust performance:
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
- **Model Selection and Training**: Machine learning models, including ARIMA for time series and LSTM for deep learning, are trained on historical stock data and sentiment analysis results.
- **Addressing Class Imbalance**: Techniques like oversampling and undersampling are used to balance the dataset, ensuring accurate predictions across different market conditions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model, with a focus on both quantitative and qualitative predictions.

#### Results and Interpretation
Tradon's final model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities, with key performance metrics indicating its effectiveness:
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy in predicting stock price movements, supported by robust time series and sentiment analysis models.
- **Precision and Recall**: Balanced precision and recall across different market conditions, showcasing the model's ability to capture nuanced market dynamics.
- **F1-Score**: A high F1-score reflecting the model's overall performance in making accurate and reliable predictions.

#### Conclusion
Tradon exemplifies the application of advanced AI techniques in stock market forecasting. The integration of Time Series Analysis, NLP, captivating frontend design, and MongoDB cloud integration provides investors with actionable insights and predictive capabilities. This project, developed by a team of pre-final year BCA students, represents a significant step towards informed decision-making and optimized investment strategies, demonstrating a comprehensive and innovative approach to financial technology.
