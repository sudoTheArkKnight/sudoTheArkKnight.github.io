UCI Adult Census Income Classification
Project Overview

The UCI Adult Census Income Classification project aims to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K per year based on demographic and employment data. Leveraging the UCI Adult Census dataset, this project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation to develop a robust classification model.
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

The preprocessing phase is critical for ensuring the quality and suitability of the dataset for model training. Key steps include:

    Data Loading and Initial Inspection: The dataset was loaded using pandas, with explicit column naming to ensure clarity. Initial inspections highlighted issues such as missing values and class imbalance.

    Handling Missing Values: Features such as 'workclass', 'occupation', and 'native-country' contained missing values. Various imputation strategies were considered; however, it was found that not handling these missing values yielded better model performance, maintaining an accuracy of approximately 83%.

    Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical features were transformed into numerical representations using OrdinalEncoder, which is essential for algorithms like Random Forests that require numerical input.

    Feature Engineering and Selection: Feature importance was evaluated using a RandomForestClassifier, which helped in identifying and retaining the most impactful features, thereby reducing dimensionality and improving model efficiency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA provided insights into the dataset's structure and highlighted important trends:

    Income Distribution: A significant imbalance was observed, with the majority of individuals earning <=50K.
    Demographic Insights: Gender, race, and marital status were found to correlate with income, indicating systemic disparities.
    Work and Education: Higher education levels and longer work hours were generally associated with higher income, though the relationship plateaued at extreme values.

Model Training and Evaluation

    Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80-20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

    Model Selection and Training: A RandomForestClassifier was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle various data types. The model was trained on the most important features identified during preprocessing.

    Addressing Class Imbalance: The minority class (>50K) was oversampled to balance the training set, enhancing the model's ability to predict both classes accurately.

    Model Evaluation: The model's performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately 84.67%, with balanced precision and recall across both income classes, indicating robust performance.

Results and Interpretation

The final model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, with key performance metrics as follows:

    Accuracy: 84.67%
    Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Balanced metrics across both income classes, highlighting the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between different income levels.

Conclusion

This project showcases the application of advanced data science techniques to solve a real-world classification problem. The systematic approach to data preprocessing, insightful exploratory analysis, and rigorous model training and evaluation underscore expertise in handling complex datasets and developing robust predictive models.
