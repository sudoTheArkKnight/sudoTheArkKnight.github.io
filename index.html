                        <p><strong>Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:</strong></p>
                        <p>The preprocessing phase is critical for ensuring the quality and suitability of the dataset for model training. Key steps include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data Loading and Initial Inspection:</strong> The dataset was loaded using pandas, with explicit column naming to ensure clarity. Initial inspections highlighted issues such as missing values and class imbalance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Handling Missing Values:</strong> Features such as 'workclass', 'occupation', and 'native-country' contained missing values. Various imputation strategies were considered; however, it was found that not handling these missing values yielded better model performance, maintaining an accuracy of approximately 83%.</li>
                            <li><strong>Encoding Categorical Variables:</strong> Categorical features were transformed into numerical representations using OrdinalEncoder, which is essential for algorithms like Random Forests that require numerical input.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feature Engineering and Selection:</strong> Feature importance was evaluated using a RandomForestClassifier, which helped in identifying and retaining the most impactful features, thereby reducing dimensionality and improving model efficiency.</li>
                        </ul>
        
                        <p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong></p>
                        <p>EDA provided insights into the dataset's structure and highlighted important trends:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Income Distribution:</strong> A significant imbalance was observed, with the majority of individuals earning <=50K.</li>
                            <li><strong>Demographic Insights:</strong> Gender, race, and marital status were found to correlate with income, indicating systemic disparities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Work and Education:</strong> Higher education levels and longer work hours were generally associated with higher income, though the relationship plateaued at extreme values.</li>
                        </ul>
        
                        <p><strong>Model Training and Evaluation:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data Splitting:</strong> The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80-20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Model Selection and Training:</strong> A RandomForestClassifier was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle various data types. The model was trained on the most important features identified during preprocessing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Addressing Class Imbalance:</strong> The minority class (>50K) was over sampled to balance the training set, enhancing the model's ability to predict both classes accurately.</li>
                            <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> The model's performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately 84.67%, with balanced precision and recall across both income classes, indicating robust performance.</li>
                        </ul>
        
                        <p><strong>Results and Interpretation:</strong></p>
                        <p>The final model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, with key performance metrics as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 84.67%</li>
                            <li><strong>Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:</strong> Balanced metrics across both income classes, highlighting the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between different income levels.</li>
                        </ul>
        
                        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This project showcases the application of advanced data science techniques to solve a real-world classification problem. The systematic approach to data preprocessing, insightful exploratory analysis, and rigorous model training and evaluation underscore expertise in handling complex datasets and developing robust predictive models.</p>
